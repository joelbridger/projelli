# Plan: Projelli V1 Launch

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (Manual - Do on Windows)

**✅ TypeScript error FIXED! Missing workspace module added to repo.**

**Now build and release on native Windows:**

1. **Open Windows PowerShell** (not WSL)
2. **Navigate to project:** `cd C:\Users\james\Projects\projelli`
3. **Pull latest code:** `git pull origin master` ⬅️ **IMPORTANT: Pulls the fix!**
4. **Install Rust** (if not installed): `winget install Rustlang.Rustup`
5. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
6. **Build for production:** `npm run tauri build`
   - First build may take 10-15 minutes (compiling Rust dependencies)
   - Output: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Projelli_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe`
   - Output: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/Projelli_1.0.0_x64_en-US.msi`
7. **Create GitHub Release:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/joelbridger/projelli/releases/new?tag=v1.0.0
   - Title: "Projelli v1.0.0 - Initial Release"
   - Description: "First public release of Projelli - Local-first AI workspace"
   - Upload both installers (.exe and .msi)
   - Publish release
8. **Verify:** Visit https://projelli.com and test download

**Project:** `/mnt/c/Users/james/Projects/projelli/`
**Website:** `website/index.html` (self-contained landing page)
**Hosting:** Home server at `ssh jameson@10.0.0.88`
**GitHub:** https://github.com/joelbridger/projelli
**Strategy:** Ship all features free, add monetization later

---

## Current State

- All 41 core tickets DONE
- All 11 Windows UI fixes DONE
- All 26 migration tickets DONE
- 200+ uncommitted changes on `feature/windows-desktop-migration` branch
- Website exists but download links are placeholders (`#`)
- Never built on native Windows yet (WSL2 development only)

---

## Phase 0: Create Launch Documentation ✅

### LAUNCH-000: Create V1_LAUNCH_PLAN.md ✅
- **File:** `/mnt/c/Users/james/Projects/projelli/V1_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`
- Create permanent launch plan document in project root
- Include all analysis, decisions, and checklist for V1 launch
- Track progress as we execute each step

---

## Phase 1: Commit & Merge ✅

### LAUNCH-001: Create GitHub Repository ✅
- **URL:** `https://github.com/joelbridger/projelli`
- ✅ Created public repo using `gh repo create`
- ✅ Remote configured to HTTPS (due to SSH auth limitations)

### LAUNCH-002: Commit All Changes ✅
- ✅ Committed 274 files with 8,457 insertions
- ✅ Merged `feature/windows-desktop-migration` to `master`
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub (excluding workflow files due to OAuth scope)
- **Note:** Workflow files in `.github/workflows` need manual push with `workflow` scope

### LAUNCH-002b: Fix Build Issues ✅
- ❌ **Issue found:** TypeScript error in PathValidator.ts (line 192)
- ❌ **Critical issue:** Entire `src/modules/workspace/` module was missing from Git!
  - Cause: `.gitignore` had `workspace/` which caught both user data AND source code
- ✅ **Fixed:** Updated `.gitignore` to `/workspace/` (root-level only)
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added 14 missing workspace files (3,844 lines of code!)
- ✅ **Fixed:** TypeScript strict null check in PathValidator.ts
- ✅ Pushed all fixes to GitHub

---

## Phase 2: Windows Build

### LAUNCH-003: Install Rust on Windows (Native, Not WSL) ⏸️
- Open **Windows PowerShell** (not WSL)
- Download and run: `winget install Rustlang.Rustup` or https://rustup.rs
- Verify: `rustc --version`
- This is required because WSL2 cannot produce Windows .exe files
- **NOTE:** This step must be done manually on native Windows

### LAUNCH-004: First Tauri Build ⏸️
- Open **Windows Terminal** (PowerShell, not WSL)
- Navigate to project: `cd C:\Users\james\Projects\projelli`
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Dev build (generates Cargo.lock): `npm run tauri dev`
- Wait for Rust compilation (first build takes a while)
- Test the app manually
- **NOTE:** This step must be done manually on native Windows

### LAUNCH-005: Production Build ⏸️
- **Command:** `npm run tauri build`
- **Output:**
  - `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/Projelli_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi`
  - `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Projelli_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`
- Quick smoke test: install and run the .exe
- **NOTE:** This step must be done manually on native Windows
